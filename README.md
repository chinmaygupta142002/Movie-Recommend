# Movie-Recommend
Leveraging scikit-learn and NLTK, the project intelligently processes movie data from the TMDB database. Features include advanced text processing, genre extraction, and casting insights. The recommendation engine uses cosine similarity to suggest movies based on user preferences, considering genres, keywords, cast, crew, and movie overviews.
